    graphs that show current population
    tally number of living organisms
    win condition
    baby bugs
    counter of how many bugs died of what

Discussion
    Why is expressed statistic really be the greater of the two genes? Should dominance work like that? If it stays that way, the noms' and rawrs' stats should probably be increased. --RJ

    Long legs are currently *very* strongly selected for, while a bug can survive with not-so-good scores on the other traits. Should this be balanced?

    Should sexiness also affect the time a bug must wait before being ready to breed?

    Would be interesting if bugs went toward sexy bugs when ready to mate.
