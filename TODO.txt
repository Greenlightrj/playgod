MVP
    clean up results of messily smushing code together, comment code- RJ
    make bugs' chance of being killed by rawr more dependent on the stat difference. - CAZ (for all subsections)
        --neither rawrs nor bugs currently have a stat like this, are we okay with giving bugs another gene?
        --I think i meant chance of bugs being killed by noms they're trying to eat, although this would also be good probably.
    ability to change environment
        --Use hunting stat as attack AND defense--kills bug if it fails hunting check
        --Is this a speed problem for anyone yet? I kind of like the gradient variation.
    implement drag and drop functionality for environment and bugs - RJ
    implement add bug/nom/rawr buttons - CAZ (copy code from shapespaint)
    Make bugs smaller to be in scale with rawrs and noms - RJ
    Don't die - all (esp. Marie-Caroline)


Frills
    Title screen
    Buttons to place each type of item
    sliders?
    speciation?
    variation in detection radius?
    make noms' and rawrs' stats visible
    mouseover to see an organism's stats
    graphs that show current population
    tally number of living organisms
    win condition
    baby bugs
    click and drag the organisms
    counter of how many bugs died of what

Discussion
    Why is expressed statistic really be the greater of the two genes? Should dominance work like that? If it stays that way, the noms' and rawrs' stats should probably be increased. --RJ

    Long legs are currently *very* strongly selected for, while a bug can survive with not-so-good scores on the other traits. Should this be balanced?

    Should sexiness also affect the time a bug must wait before being ready to breed?

    Would be interesting if bugs went toward sexy bugs when ready to mate.
