Discussion
    Why is main copy still a thing?

    What if sexiness for mating were the distance from 0 of the colors, rather than the distance from the background? Camouflage would still be relative to the background.

    Why is expressed statistic really be the greater of the two genes? Should dominance work like that? If it stays that way, the noms' and rawrs' stats should probably be increased. --RJ

    Should sexiness also affect the time a bug must wait before being ready to breed?

    Would be interesting if bugs went toward sexy bugs when ready to mate.
