    clean up results of messily smushing code together, comment code- RJ
    make bugs' chance of being killed by rawr more dependent on the stat difference. 
        --neither rawrs nor bugs currently have a stat like this, are we okay with giving bugs another gene?
        --I think i meant chance of bugs being killed by noms they're trying to eat, although this would also be good probably.
    ability to change environment
    make bugs into sprites instead of a collection of Rects
        --Is this a speed problem for anyone yet? I kind of like the gradient variation.
    make bugs not jitter at detection radius when noms are hiding behind rawrs


Frills
    Title screen
    Buttons to place each type of item
    sliders?
    speciation?
    variation in detection radius?
    make noms' and rawrs' stats visible
    mouseover to see an organism's stats
    graphs that show current population
    tally number of living organisms
    win condition
    baby bugs
    click and drag the organisms
    counter of how many bugs died of what

Discussion
    Why is expressed statistic really be the greater of the two genes? Should dominance work like that? If it stays that way, the noms' and rawrs' stats should probably be increased. --RJ

    Long legs are currently *very* strongly selected for, while a bug can survive with not-so-good scores on the other traits. Should this be balanced?

    Should sexiness also affect the time a bug must wait before being ready to breed?

    Would be interesting if bugs went toward sexy bugs when ready to mate.
