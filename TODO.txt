Discussion

    What if sexiness for mating were the distance from 0 of the colors, rather than the distance from the background? Camouflage would still be relative to the background.

    Should leg length factor into warmth? Drowning? Should drowning be directly related to camelstat and not thirst?

    What if the three colors coded for three environmental factors: Red for heat, blue for water, green for friendliness of noms/rawrs? 

    Why is expressed statistic really be the greater of the two genes? Should dominance work like that? If it stays that way, the noms' and rawrs' stats should probably be increased. --RJ

    Long legs are currently *very* strongly selected for, while a bug can survive with not-so-good scores on the other traits. Should this be balanced?

    Should sexiness also affect the time a bug must wait before being ready to breed?

    Would be interesting if bugs went toward sexy bugs when ready to mate.
